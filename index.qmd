Here is your roadmap for the semester.  Each week, follow the general process below:

- Read the assigned weekly material before coming to class. Use the textbook as a reference if there are ideas that are unclear.  Write down anything you find interesting or unclear.
- Attend class, participate fully.  Present your thoughts on the readings.
- Write a reflection based on the in-class discussion as well as your interpretation of the readings.
